# **Air Quality Forecasting using Time Series Machine Learning Models**

---

## 1. Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that predicts future air quality levels based on historical air quality data and relevant environmental factors.

## 2. Context/ Problem Statement

A few years ago, China established the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on the level of five pollutant atmospheres, namely sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) measured at monitoring stations in each city.

## 6. Key insights from Exploratory Data Analysis

### Univariate analysis

#### Air Pollutants

- PM2.5 and PM10 are dangerously high with occasional extreme peaks.(PM2.5 - Mean: 83.16, SD:82.29, Median:60, Min-Max: 3-898), - PM10 - (Mean: 110.73, SD:95.37, Median:88, Min- Max:2-984)
- SO2: Mostly controlled, but occasional high levels suggest industrial emissions. (Mean:17.57, SD:22.82, Median:9, Min-Max:0.29 - 341)
- NO2 levels are consistently high, indicating major traffic or industrial contributions.(Mean:59.29, SD:37.00, Median:54, Min-Max:2 - 290)
- CO levels vary greatly, suggesting pollution hotspots. (Mean:1267.07, SD:1242.12, Median:900, Min-Max:100 - 10,000)
- 03 pollution is seasonal and affected by sunlight and NOâ‚‚ emissions. (Mean:55.18, SD:57.58, Median:41, Min-Max:0.21 - 423)

#### Environmental Factors

There are large seasonal variations in temperature and dew point with bimodal distributions. In terms of rainfall, there are mostly dry conditions, with rare heavy rainfall events. Pressure remains stable, with minor variations. Light winds dominate, but occasional strong gusts occur. The wind direction is variable.

### Bivariate analysis

#### Trend analysis

Seasonal Trends:
  
Daily trends

PM2.5 and PM10 follow similar trends, suggesting shared pollution sources. SO2, NO2, and CO show mid-month peaks. Ozone rises gradually, indicating photochemical formation.
  
Monthly trends

Winter months show high PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO levels. Summer months have higher O3 levels. Spring and autumn act as transition periods between these extremes.

Yearly trends

There is an increase in PM2.5 & PM10 from 2013 to 2014 followed by a decline until 2016, then a  sharp rise in 2017. There is a steady decline in SO2 levels from 2013 to 2016, however, a noticeable increase in 2017. NO2 levels are relatively stable until 2015 followed by a decline in 2016 with a s sharp increase in 2017. For CO levels, a general upward trend from 2013 to 2015 indicating worsening air quality. Then a decline in 2016 followed by a sharp increase in 2017. There is a steady increase in 03 levels from 2013 to 2015 peaking in 2015, then declines slightly in 2016 and drops significantly in 2017.

#### Correlation Analysis

There is strong positive linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other increases) between PM2.5 & PM10, temperature & dewpoint temperature, PM 2.5 & CO. A strong negative relationship between PRES & DEWP and TEMP & PRES. 

### Multivariate analysis

#### Prediciting future fine particulate matter levels (PM2.5)

ARIMA(1,1,2) model for prediction, where 3 predictor variables have effects. Dew point has a highly significant positive effect, pressure and wind direction have small negative effects.

#### Prediciting future coarse particulate matter levels

ARIMA(2,1,2) model for prediction, where 4 predictor variables have effects. Dew point and wind speed have strong significant positive effects, while rain, wind direction and presure are negatively associated.

#### Prediciting future sulphur dioxide levels

ARIMA(2,1,2) model for prediction, where 4 predictor variables have effects. Dew point has a strong significant positive effect, while temperature and pressure have significant negative effects, with wind direction having a small negative effect.

#### Predicting future nitrogen dioxide levels

ARIMA(1,0,1) model for prediction, where 4 predictor variables have effects. Dew point has a strong significant positive effect, while temperature and pressure have significant negative effects, with wind direction having a small negative effect.

#### Prediciting future carbon monoxide levels

ARIMA(2,1,1) model for for prediction, where 3 predictor variables have effects. Dew point has a strong significant positive effect, temperature has a strong significant negative effect while wind direction has a small negative effect.

#### Prediciting 0zone levels

ARIMA 2,0,1 Model for prediction, where 2 predictor variables have effects. Temperature has a strong significant positive effect and rain has a small positive effect.
